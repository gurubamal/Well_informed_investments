**Title: One-Week Investment Analysis of  <Company Name>**

---

**Instructions:**

- **Role Play:** Assume the role of a seasoned financial analyst with extensive experience in ultra-short-term stock trading (one-week period).

- **Detailed Analysis:** Execute a thorough analysis as a professional analyst would, meticulously addressing each step without providing a general framework.

- **Best Judgment:** Utilize your best judgment in all analyses, disregarding any capability limitations.

- **Data Sources:** Base your analysis on the most reliable and up-to-date publicly available data accessible to you, such as intraday market trends, technical indicators, recent news, earnings reports, and reputable financial news outlets. Disregard the need for any specific financial data that isn't accessible.

- **Focus Note:** Concentrate on ultra-short-term factors that could impact the stock price within the next week. Do not include long-term valuation methods or fundamental analysis that are not relevant for a one-week horizon.

- **Introduction and Conclusion:** In these sections, explicitly outline the expected short-term return and provide clear Buy/Sell/Hold recommendations. Use high-level analyses based on the reliable data sources noted earlier. Avoid general recommendations or frameworks for generating recommendations.

- **Format Adherence:** Strictly adhere to the format provided below.

- **Data Presentation:** Include **maximum data in tables** wherever possible to make the analysis easy to use. Ensure that all financial metrics, technical indicators, comparisons, and analyses are presented in tables with clear headings and labels.

- **Comprehensive Metrics:** Incorporate technical indicators and trading signals such as **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**, **Moving Averages (MA)**, **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**, **Volume Analysis**, **Bollinger Bands**, **Stochastic Oscillator**, **Pivot Points**, **Support and Resistance Levels**, and other relevant ultra-short-term indicators.

- **Actual Names:** When referencing competitors, analyst firms, or any entities, use the actual names instead of placeholders.

- **Stock Price Analysis:** Include an analysis of very recent price movements, intraday trends, high-frequency trading signals, and any immediate events that may impact the stock price in the next week.

- **Evaluation and Scoring:**
  - Assign numerical values to evaluations: **Positive = +1**, **Neutral = 0**, **Negative = -1**.
  - Apply these scores to all measurable items in the tables.
  - **Calculation of Confidence Level:**
    - **Total Score:** Sum all the individual scores from each evaluation.
    - **Maximum Possible Score:** Total number of evaluations multiplied by +1.
    - **Confidence Percentage:** Calculate the percentage confidence in the stock using the formula:

      \[
      \text{Confidence Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Total Score} + \text{Maximum Possible Score}}{2 \times \text{Maximum Possible Score}} \right) \times 100\%
      \]

      This scales the confidence percentage between 0% and 100%.

    - **Interpretation:**
      - **Confidence Percentage > 66%:** Strong confidence (**Buy**).
      - **Confidence Percentage between 33% and 66%:** Moderate confidence (**Hold**).
      - **Confidence Percentage < 33%:** Low confidence (**Sell**).
    - Apply the best possible reasoning to interpret the confidence percentage and conclude whether \<Company Name\> is a good ultra-short-term investment opportunity.
