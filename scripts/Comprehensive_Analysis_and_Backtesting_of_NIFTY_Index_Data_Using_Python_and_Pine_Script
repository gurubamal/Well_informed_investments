### **Prompt 3: Strategy Backtesting**

Perform the following steps to backtest a moving average crossover strategy:

1. **Calculate Moving Averages:**

   - **Data Preparation:**

     - Use the past 5 years of historical data.

   - **Calculations:**

     - Calculate the 21-day and 50-day SMAs.

     - **Sell Signal (-1):**

       - When the 21-day SMA crosses below the 50-day SMA from above.

     - **No Signal (0):**

       - Otherwise.

   - **Signal Generation:**

### **Prompt 4: Pine Script Development**

Create a TradingView Pine Script for the following trading strategy:

1. **Trading Strategy Rules:**

   - **Buy Signal:**

     - When the candle closes above the highest price of the last 52 weeks (252 trading days).

   - **Sell Signal:**

     - When the candle closes below the lowest price of the last 52 weeks.

2. **Pine Script Requirements:**

   - **Version:**

     - Use Pine Script version 4 or 5.

   - **Script Structure:**

     - Define inputs for flexibility (e.g., length of high/low periods).

     - Include comments explaining each section.

   - **Signal Visualization:**

     - Plot buy and sell signals on the chart.

     - Use distinct colors or shapes for clarity.

   - **Alerts:**

     - Include alert conditions for buy and sell signals.

3. **Code Example:**

```pine
//@version=4
study("52-Week High/Low Breakout Strategy", overlay=true)

// Define the lookback period (default to 252 trading days)
length = input(252, title="52-Week Period Length")

// Calculate the highest high and lowest low over the period
highestHigh = highest(high, length)
lowestLow = lowest(low, length)

// Buy signal when price closes above the highest high
buySignal = close > highestHigh[1]

// Sell signal when price closes below the lowest low
sellSignal = close < lowestLow[1]

// Plot signals
plotshape(buySignal, title="Buy Signal", location=location.belowbar, shape=shape.triangleup, color=color.green, size=size.small)
plotshape(sellSignal, title="Sell Signal", location=location.abovebar, shape=shape.triangledown, color=color.red, size=size.small)

// Optional: Plot highest high and lowest low lines
plot(highestHigh, title="52-Week High", color=color.blue, linewidth=1, style=plot.style_line)
plot(lowestLow, title="52-Week Low", color=color.orange, linewidth=1, style=plot.style_line)

// Alerts
alertcondition(buySignal, title="Buy Alert", message="Buy Signal: Price closed above 52-week high")
alertcondition(sellSignal, title="Sell Alert", message="Sell Signal: Price closed below 52-week low")
```

4. **Testing and Validation:**

   - **Ensure No Errors:**

     - The script should run without errors on TradingView.

   - **Backtesting Capability:**

     - The script can be applied to historical data to visualize past signals.
