**Title: Short-Term Investment Analysis of \<Company Name\>**

---

**Instructions:**

- **Role Play:** Assume the role of a seasoned financial expert with extensive experience in short-term stock trading (15-60 days).

- **Detailed Analysis:** Execute a thorough analysis as a professional analyst would, meticulously addressing each step without providing a general framework.

- **Best Judgment:** Utilize your best judgment in all analyses, disregarding any capability limitations.

- **Data Sources:** Base your analysis on the most reliable and up-to-date publicly available data accessible to you, such as recent market trends, technical indicators, company news, and reputable financial news outlets. Disregard the need for any specific financial data that isn't accessible.

- **Focus Note:** Concentrate on short-term factors that could impact the stock price within the next 15-60 days. Do not include long-term valuation methods such as Discounted Cash Flow (DCF).

- **Introduction and Conclusion:** In these sections, explicitly outline the expected short-term return and provide clear Buy/Sell/Hold recommendations. Use high-level analyses based on the reliable data sources noted earlier. Avoid general recommendations or frameworks for generating recommendations.

- **Format Adherence:** Strictly adhere to the format provided below.

- **Data Presentation:** Include **maximum data in tables** wherever possible to make the analysis easy to use. Ensure that all financial metrics, technical indicators, comparisons, and analyses are presented in tables with clear headings and labels.

- **Comprehensive Metrics:** Incorporate technical indicators such as **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**, **Moving Averages (MA)**, **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**, **Volume Analysis**, **Bollinger Bands**, and other relevant short-term indicators.

- **Actual Names:** When referencing competitors, analyst firms, or any entities, use the actual names instead of placeholders.

- **Stock Price Analysis:** Include an analysis of recent price movements, support and resistance levels, and any upcoming events that may impact the stock price in the next 15-60 days.

- **Evaluation and Scoring:**
  - Assign numerical values to evaluations: **Positive = +1**, **Neutral = 0**, **Negative = -1**.
  - Apply these scores to all measurable items in the tables.
  - **Calculation of Confidence Level:**
    - **Total Score:** Sum all the individual scores from each evaluation.
    - **Maximum Possible Score:** Total number of evaluations multiplied by +1.
    - **Confidence Percentage:** Calculate the percentage confidence in the stock using the formula:

      \[
      \text{Confidence Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Total Score} + \text{Maximum Possible Score}}{2 \times \text{Maximum Possible Score}} \right) \times 100\%
      \]

      This scales the confidence percentage between 0% and 100%.

    - **Interpretation:**
      - **Confidence Percentage > 66%:** Strong confidence (**Buy**).
      - **Confidence Percentage between 33% and 66%:** Moderate confidence (**Hold**).
      - **Confidence Percentage < 33%:** Low confidence (**Sell**).
    - Apply the best possible reasoning to interpret the confidence percentage and conclude whether \<Company Name\> is a good short-term investment opportunity.
